# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

There are security features built-in to prevent unauthorized access to custom URLs. It has stat tracking to count link clicks and unique visitors to each link. Only users that created a link are able to edit/delete them!
